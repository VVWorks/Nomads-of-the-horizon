Wellcome to Nomads of the horizon, a free game for Android.

All the features this game contains are completely free. The game does not collect any kind of data from users, does not require internet access and 
cannot be used as a threat in any possible way. It is designed to be family friendly and is accesible to all ages.

The game saves data like player score and other only in game related information locally in the device memory. 
This data is not collected, can easily be deleted and also does not contain any personal information at all.

The game does not contain in-app purchases or ads.

If the release goes well i will make this project open source.
